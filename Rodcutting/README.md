Problem:
Consider a modification of the rod-cutting problem in which, in addition to a price
p_i for each rod, each cut incurs a fixed cost of c. The revenue associated with a solution is now the sum of the peices minus the cost of making the cut.

Program: set the defined variable c to some number. Returns cost max revenue of length 1 to n, cost max revenue = max revenue - c 

length i | 1 2 3 4 5  6  7  8  9  10
price p_i| 1 4 5 9 10 12 15 18 19 20
